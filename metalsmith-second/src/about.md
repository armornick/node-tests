The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right?

And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack.

And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has
paid me in frickin' almost a decade.
