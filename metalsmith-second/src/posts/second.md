I don't want to go. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable!

New-new-Doctor. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors!
